# Programming Notes Repository

This Git repository is created to store my programming notes in markdown format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to write plain text documents using a simple syntax.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
programming-notes/
├── language-1.md
├── language-2.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

## Usage
I can use my code editor to create and edit markdown files inside the notes/ directory. Whenever I make changes, I can commit and push my changes to the remote repository.

<!-- To make my notes more accessible, I can use GitHub Pages to host my notes repository as a website. This way, I can share my notes with others and access them from anywhere. -->

## Conclusion
By using this Git repository to store my programming notes in markdown format, I can organize my notes effectively and keep them synchronized across different devices. I can also use this repository to collaborate with others who are studying the same programming languages.
